The 1-km GDP raster for China is not stored in the repository due to size.
It can be downloaded from the dataset published on Figshare (search “1-km GDP China raster”). After downloading the GeoTIFF file, place it in this folder under the name china_gdp_1km_2020.tif. The Sichuan adaptation notebooks expect this filename.
