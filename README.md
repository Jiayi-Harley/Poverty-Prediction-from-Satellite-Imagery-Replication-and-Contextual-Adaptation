# Poverty-Prediction-from-Satellite-Imagery-Replication-and-Contextual-Adaptation
This repository contains my replication of the baseline methodology from Jean et al. (2016), “Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty,” Science.
The goal of this coursework is twofold:

Replicate the original AI method using the open dataset, achieving results within ±5% of the published metrics.

Adapt the same methodology to a new geographical context (Sichuan, China) to address SDG 1 – No Poverty.
